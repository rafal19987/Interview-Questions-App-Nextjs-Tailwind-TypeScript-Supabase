# About APP

## JavaScript Interview Questions APP is my first application created using TypeScript, Tailwind, React, Next.js. The main idea of the application is to help you prepare for javascript interviews. The database of questions will be constantly expanded.

## The application is currently in the implementation phase and not all functionalities have been implemented. Among other things, it lacks support for all resolutions, so it's worth checking it out in the mobile view. You can check the original stylistic idea of the application through the shared prototype in Figma, which was prepared by me.
